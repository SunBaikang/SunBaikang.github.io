Here is **Baikang Sun (孙百康)**.

   I am a third-year graduate student from China, majoring in Transportation at the School of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The laboratory I am in is the Airworthiness Management and Computer Vision Laboratory. I am studying and researching under the guidance of Teacher [Li Yanjun](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/lyj/zh_CN/index.htm).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *hanlin[dot]cai[at]ieee[dot]org*

## Research Interests

- Computer vision
- Fault diagnosis
- Ergonomics

   My current research focus is on detecting small targets in complex backgrounds. My interest is the application of **deep learning** in the recognition of **small targets**, and technologies such as artificial intelligence and target recognition have positively impacted society. I hope to continue to delve deeper into such meaningful matters.
